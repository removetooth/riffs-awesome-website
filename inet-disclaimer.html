<b>Disclaimer!</b>
<br><br>
Most websites around today have a security feature that allows them<br>
to refuse to be embedded in other websites.<br><br>
I'm not sure why this is a thing, honestly. I think website-ception is fun,<br>
but clearly, I'm in the minority here.<br><br>
In fact, a majority of the features that would make this actually fun to use<br>
are handicapped by cross-site security restrictions.<br>
There won't be a back button, the URL bar won't update,<br>
and most pages will outright refuse to load.<br>
The ones that do, though, are the really fun ones.<br><br>
I still think that having an old web browser in your new web browser<br>
is a fun enough concept that I'm going to leave it in anyway.<br><br>
Just don't expect every website to work.<br><br>
That said, here's some really fascinating pages that DO work:<br>
