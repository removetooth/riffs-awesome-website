### ok, but for real
"why is there a README.html that tells me nothing?" you may be asking yourself. don't worry. that's what README.md is for, and README.md says that README.html exists as an artistic touch to the website, and does not serve as an actual readme. it's also because i added it before i started using git to track my changes to the website- up until the time of writing, i've been making all my edits live!

this website is actively being written by someone with almost zero prior web development experience, save for making one webpage as a kid, and then constantly goofing off with inspect element in junior high. 

i had a lot of fun doing those things, and learned a lot too! but the language of the internet has evolved quite a bit since then. it's become far more reliant on things like CSS and the HTML5 standard.

if it wasn't already obvious by the general aesthetic of the website, i'm old-fashioned. you're going to see a lot of *very* stupid javascript, minimalistic CSS, and many deprecated HTML elements, like font and marquee. i didn't even know that marquee existed up until a week ago, but now that i do, I LOVE IT. i REFUSE to stop using it.

slowly but surely, though, i'm learning better practice. i'm updating some of the things on the website to be less stupid, though i'll leave some as-is as an artistic decision- like, if it were made in the time period i'm emulating, would it have been written this way?

**TL;DR: this website is under active construction. i'm learning; don't judge me for it!**

### so why exactly does this exist
i'm not exactly sure myself. the original idea was for it to be some kind of hybrid art-project-resume thing, but i'm really just adding things to it as i please! it's a blank canvas, and i will paint on it. i'm taking heavy inspiration from the windows 98-XP era of computing, the infancy of the internet, and modern websites mimicking the era such as http://www.themostamazingwebsiteontheinternet.com/ (which you should totally check out, because it's the most amazing website on the internet.)

essentially, i want to show off my projects, but i want it to be a project in and of itself, too. **we've all boxed ourselves into these massive media platforms, but it's nice once in a while to just step back and explore the wider web.** the general point of this website is to capture the feeling of doing exactly that, like we used to do as kids. i want the CSS to roughly mimic old Windows UI, i want to have a taskbar and applications that you can use over a scrollable portfolio of my own work- that, i think, is my immediate plan.

i don't want to spend too much time trying to justify making a website as an art piece- right now, i'm itching to work on the website itself, so i'm going to end this readme here. i hope you'll enjoy what i create!
